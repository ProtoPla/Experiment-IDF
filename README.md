# Learning the ESP-IDF Framework

## About this repo

This repository is dedicated to my learning of the **ESP-IDF** after working extensively with Arduino.  
The main goals are:

- Understanding the basics of acquiring data from sensors using ESP-IDF  
- Setting up Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to transmit and receive data
